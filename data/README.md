# Data

`stock_prices.csv`: daily adjusted closing prices of 20 US stocks, 1989-12-29 to 2018-04-11.

Caveat: the tickers are well-known companies chosen today, so any backtest on them has
survivorship bias. The case study compares strategies on the same universe, which is fair
between strategies but flatters absolute returns.
